library(ggmap)
```

Load our location data

```{r}
#this is a spreadsheet with the 23 EMCR presenters (both talks and posters) pulled from the ASSC 2021 conference booklet which can be found at: https://www.seedpartnership.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ASSC-2021-Program-Booklet.pdf

EMCRlocationdata <- read.csv("ASSC EMCR talks by theme.csv")
```

Constructing world map for base

```{r}
WorldMap <- ggplot() + borders("world", colour="black", fill="#C7DBC8") + theme_classic()
WorldMap
```
Add our location points to world map

```{r}
MyMap <- WorldMap + 
  geom_point(aes(x=Long, y=Lat), data = EMCRlocationdata, colour = "#262A76", size =3, alpha=0.9, shape=17) +
  ylim(-65,90)
MyMap
```

Now creating a map of Australia as an inlay for this world map

```{r}
AusMap <- WorldMap + 
  geom_point(aes(x=Long, y=Lat), data = EMCRlocationdata, colour = "#262A76", size =5, alpha=0.8, shape=17) +
  ylim(-45,-11) +
  xlim(110, 155)
AusMap
```
